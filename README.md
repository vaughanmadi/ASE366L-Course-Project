Course Project: Observing the Effects of Special Perturbations on Orbit Propagation

This project was assigned to me during my Spring 2022 semester taking the elective "Applied Orbital Mechanics". The inital project goal was to indentify and compare the 
different effects that special perturbations might have on various orbit trajectories. This project was especially fun because we had to write our propogators from 
scratch and then visualize and assess these perturbations, and it let me discover my love for orbital mechanics. 

The second portion of the project was to read through the old NASA theory documentation by T.H. Skopinski and K.G. Johnson “Determination of Azimuth Angle at Burnout for 
Placing a Satellite Over a elected Earth Position”. We had to write an iterative solver that would solve for the azimuth angle and estimate where on Earth the supposed 
satellite might burnout, and then compare that to a high fidelity propogation. This portion was a bit more challenging, and for the time I had to work on the project, I 
was unable to get entirely accurate results for the high fidelity propagator. Still, I found this part of the project to be very fun because of the challenge it 
presented.
